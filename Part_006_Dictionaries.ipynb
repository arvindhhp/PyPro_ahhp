    "Finally, Dictionaries. Yessssss, I wanted a compelete blog post dedicated just to discuss dictionaries. With dictioanries, we are moving into complex data types from basic data types like int, float, bool. Dictionaries are a mixture of all the data types we have learnt until now. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let me summarise the features of dictionaries before we proceed in detail:\n",
    "Dictionaries are MUTABLE, they can contain any type of data within them, they can be indexed (unlike SETS), but they also have this unqiue feature - dictionaries store data in the form of KEY-VALUE pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "To put in simpler terms, we know that LISTS, STRINGS, TUPLES have predefined indices from 0 to len(object) - 1. But in case of dictioanries, the indices are also user defined, these user defined indices are what we call KEYS. Values correspond to the elements stored at each of the index locations  or what we call as KEYS. Dictionary indexing is done using KEYS rather than the usual index using a number as in LISTS or STRINGS. We will look into the syntax soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "DICTIONARIES are also UNORDERED data types. The sequence of the data storage has no meaning. But the KEY VALUE pairs are always mapped properly. Just that, there is NO specific sequence asserting the order in which KEY-VALUE pairs are stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "KEYS cannot have any duplicate values, sounds reasonable, I guess, we cannot have ambigious index for an object right ?? But, two different KEYS can contain the same data as values. No restriction in having ambigious VALUES. VALUES can contain objects with any lengths and any data types, no restrictions.. But coming to the KEYs, LIST, SET and DICTIONARY datatypes cannot be used to assign a KEY. Repeating again, the VALUES could be anything, no restrictions. A specific KEY of dictioanary can store another dictionary itself as a VALUE.\n",
    "\n",
    "I guess, this elaborate introductory description is good to start off. Happy DICTIONARY usage !!!"
