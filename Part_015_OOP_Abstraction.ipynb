    "## Abstraction Ideology\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind abstraction comes from the fact that only relavant data need to be shared based on the requirement. Just imagine, what is the point of telling a doctor I like classical songs when she asks, \"what should I know before prescribing meds\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitive information, backend working methods, irrelevant data generated during the process of certain execution etc. need not be exposed to the user. The concept of enabling mutiple proprietery behaviours for various attributes and methods within the class is known as encapsulation. Encapsulation allows OOP based programming languages to have PUBLIC, PROTECTED and PRIVATE variables. The method of ensuring that only relevant information is accessible or available to the user is called as Abstraction."

    "## Public, Protected and Private Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Public, Protected and Private are the restrictions that can be applied to any attribute within the class that defines its accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public attributes/variables are those that can be accessed anywhere using the dot notation (obviously) Protected attributes/variables can be accessed only within the package Private attributes/variables can be accessed only within the class\n",
    "Usually, in OOP languages, we use keywords like Public or Private to define the scope. But in Python, we use single underscore and double underscore preceding the attribute name that signifies whether the attribute is PROTECTED or PRIVATE respectively.\n",
    "In Python, ABSTRACTION is not as stringent as in other OOP languages. The creator of Python felt that, every individual has the right to access all the variables, hence, private variables can also be accessed outside of the class. We will see in the code snippet below how this can be achieved."
