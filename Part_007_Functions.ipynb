    "If I were asked to jot down a list of most helpful yet easy to access functionalities w.r.t generic programming or coding, FUNCTIONS would be at the top of the list. One of the most basic idea of utisling programming in our daily life is getting the boring and redundant stuff we do on a daily basis happen automatically. Guess what, functions help us to achieve the same within the program. Functions are a common functionality available in most programming languages. A good program shold follow the concept of DRY, DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF !!! Functions capture all the repeative set of statements using an indentifier (fucntion name) , this can be called anywhere, any number of times and the action can be repeated with absolutely zero additional efforts."
