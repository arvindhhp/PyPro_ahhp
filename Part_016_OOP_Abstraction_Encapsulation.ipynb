    "## Abstraction and Encapsulation Ideology\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind abstraction comes from the fact that only relevant data need to be shared based on the requirement. Consider the situation, some guests are coming home and I plan to make some desert for all of us. I need some extra sugar, so I want this to be delivered to my house. All the shopkeeper need to know is the quantity of sugar and the address of my house. He does not have any business in knowing why I need this much sugar and how I estimated this number. Here, we have just communicated what is necessary and relevant for the shopkeeper. This is the IDEA of Abstraction. Sensitive information, backend working methods, irrelevant data generated during the process of certain execution etc. need not be exposed to the user. We can implement the idea of ABSTRACTION to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "While implementing ABSTRATION, we create a common template object that acts as interface and ensures only specific set of information gets transferred downstream. Like in the above case, the interface is the professional relationship between the shopkeeper and myself and the data shared is just the quantity of sugar and the delivery address.\n",
    "ABSTRACTION also comes into the picture of reusability of the code. Similar to the situation above, even Swiggy food delivery, amazon delivery and daily dairy supply need exactly the same type of inputs. This just means, a common template is applicable for all.\n",
    "\n",
    "ABSTRACTION comes into the picture in OOP when an application is being developed by multiple users at different levels. One single person cannot remember all the details of this huge class, hence it is ensured only the relevant information that needs to be transferred are permitted. And I am already guessing, the idea of ABSTRACTION is kind of clear in our minds right now. In Python, we can implement ABSTRACTION using a very simple and intuitive concept of ABSTRACT CLASS. We will discuss about this soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Food for thought, let us try to contemplate the fact:\n",
    "__Do all of us really know how does a simple print('Hello') works, the computer does not understand anything other than 0s and 1s. Some smart minds have ensured, this print('Hello') is understood well by the computer and ensured we do not need to go through all these hardships by exposing us to overwhelming information. This is a classic example of ABSTRACTION implementation.\"__\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hands, the concept of wrapping attributes and methods within a class and revealing only relevant and necessary information is known as ENCAPSULATION. The idea here is to keep the attributes, i.e. the data and the methods to be implemented on this data under the same roof, i.e a class. Basically, the moment we are using a class/object we are stepping into ENCAPSULATION.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden detail is that, as a developer, we might have defined certain attributes whose values get dynamically updated during the code execution. We really do not want any external agent to mess around with such information accidentally. But also at the same time, we cannot keep this data inaccessible at all. What if someone genuinely needs to update one such attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "__The whole process of wrapping all the attributes and its methods in a single class and then safeguarding them from accidental access and also allowing additional mechanisms to enable access to the restricted members under one roof is known as ENCAPSULATION__\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute security can be achieved by making the variables PUBLIC, PROTECTED or PRIVATE based on the requirements. To allow restricted members, we can use something called as setter() and getter() functions. We will discuss about these later in the article."

    "## ABSTRACT CLASS\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ABSTRACT class only defines empty methods, it just provides the template for its child classes to define (implement it). For example, based on the example above w.r.t 'type of product', 'quantity' and 'address', ABSTRACT class will only define empty functions to get these inputs, it won't implement how and from where these inputs need to be fetched. It must be defined in the child classes only. This is done so that any modular change in any of the downstream definitions won't affect the other objects. For example, what if the SWIGGY requires additional information of Google Map location to your house in addition to the address, but others do not need it, we can modify the implementation just within the Swiggy class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few points to remember while creating an ABSTRACT Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Needs Key word ABC (stands for Abstract Base Class)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The empty implementations need to be started with the decorator @abstractmethod *\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Child Class inheriting the Abstract Base Class must mandatorily define the implementation of all the abstract methods\n",
    "\n",
    "4) ABC cannot be instantiated. Python denies ABC object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an object is created for an ABC, there are chances, we will have access to the empty  abstract methods defined. Hence, Python ensures, ABC cannot be instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try to replicate the above example of delivery to seal our understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Details of decorators are not discussed in this article. For the time being, let us remeber this from a syntax perspective. For more information, please refer: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decorators-in-python/"
