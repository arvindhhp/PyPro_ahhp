    "\n",
    "Until now we were wandering around in the world of SCRIPTING, where the code is written directly without any representation of the real world entities and their inter-relationships. But now, we would be doing things in a more realistic way, the PYTHON way. Luckily we are working with Python which supports scripting as well OOPs."

    "## Ideology behind OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, let us try to answer ourselves, what comes to our mind when we hear the cars, laptops, animals, sports etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, as soon as I hear CAR, my mind pictures a closed body with 4 wheels, 4 doors, corresponding windows with an engine that can move. This is a generic descriptions of what a car is, what are its attributes, what are its functions etc. However, different brands, different models, different makes, different versions of car exists which have their own inherent differences of all the attributes mentioned above. But the features (feature names, a wheel is generally called a wheel regardless of the car under consideration) of a car remains same. \n",
    "In addition to the features, cars have certain behaviors like it can move either in forward or backward direction at a time, it can run with or without AC, impact of AC on mileage, max steering capacity based on speed or something.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, CAR is the class of objects while number of doors, number of wheels, brand etc. are the features of this class object. Similarly, features of different cars can be defined using the features of a common car by just updating the corresponding values. The behaviors of the car is defined as the methods of the class object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar way, analogically, we can construct our program in a fashion that can group certain similar objects (objects with similar features and methods) under a specific category called a CLASS. For example, when 2 variables 'a' and 'b' are assigned values 'hey' and 'hello' respectively, which are strings, python interprets this as two different objects of the string class. This is exactly why we get error while typecasting strings to numerical as strings do not have the inherent behavior or method to apply this transformation. These are inbuilt classes, we can also define user defined classes to meet our application requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for how something should be defined. It doesn’t actually contain any data. While the class is the blueprint, an instance is an object that is built from a class and contains real data. An instance of the CAR class is not a blueprint anymore. It’s an actual CAR with attributes like cost, brand mileage etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the idea behind OOP is to capture the features and behaviors of an object under the same software object called CLASS. Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things, like cars, as well as relations between things, like companies and employees, students and teachers, and so on. OOP models real-world entities as software objects that have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.\n"

    "## Advantage of OOP over Scripting\n",
    "\n",
    "A few advantages to start with include, it improves the reusability of the code, supports modularity, makes the code more representative of real world, allows definition of relations between multiple entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, these are the same words we used while defining functions, then during module creation and now with OOP, it just keeps getting better and better. When we used fucntions, we were automating stuff within the same code, when the same functions were defined as modules, it could be used in any code, but now when we use OOPs, the whole bunch of feature varaibles and their corresponding funcionalities or behaviours can be described using a single object. Different objects with similar features can use the features and methods from the common class already defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The verbosity ends for now, let us jump into a simple code snippets to understand what a class is, what its attributes and amthods are. By the end of this article, we will try to understand how relations between two objects can be established using OOPs."
