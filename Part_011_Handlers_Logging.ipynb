    "Logging is a very useful tool in a programmerâ€™s toolbox. It can help you develop a better understanding of the flow of a program and discover scenarios that you might not even have thought of while developing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logs provide developers with an extra set of eyes that are constantly looking at the flow that an application is going through. They can store information, like which user or IP accessed the application. If an error occurs, then they can provide more insights than a stack trace by telling you what the state of the program was before it arrived at the line of code where the error occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "By logging useful data from the right places, you can not only debug errors easily but also use the data to analyze the performance of the application to plan for scaling or look at usage patterns to plan for marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a logging system as a part of its standard library, so you can quickly add logging to your application. In this article, you will learn why using this module is the best way to add logging to your application as well as how to get started quickly, and you will get an introduction to some of the advanced features available.\n",

    "Handlers come into the picture when you want to configure your own loggers and send the logs to multiple places when they are generated. Handlers send the log messages to configured destinations like the standard output stream or a file or over HTTP or to your email via SMTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "A logger that you create can have more than one handler, which means you can set it up to be saved to a log file and also send it over email.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like loggers, you can also set the severity level in handlers. This is useful if you want to set multiple handlers for the same logger but want different severity levels for each of them. For example, you may want logs with level WARNING and above to be logged to the console, but everything with level ERROR and above should also be saved to a file."
