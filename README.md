Welocme to Python Programming basics for a non-tech professional with none to minimal programming experience by a CORE MECH-E with step by step running commentary.

With the need for exploitation of data is gushing into the daily lives of all professionals irrespective of domain, the need for aligning ourselves with the tools aiding Data Science has increased drastically. This repository has been created to aid the non-tech professionals who don't speak programming to break the shackles of fear around programming and start utilsing it on a daily basis. The term non-tech professionals is being stressed upon as each notebook has running commentaries to explain each line of code, which may be overwhelming or too rudimentary from those who are programming savy. 

This repo contains a sequence of jupyter notebooks covering concepts of Python programming from basic data types to loops to functions to exception handling and file handling.
The repo also contains a few notebooks demystifying the Object Oriented ideologies.

The content is inspired from the lessons and lectures shared by iNeuron.ai, realpython.com and other resources through different plaforms.
