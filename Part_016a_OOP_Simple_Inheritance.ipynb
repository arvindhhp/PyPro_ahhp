    "## Inheritance Ideology\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance refers to the process of obtaining something from someone. Here the giver and taker usually belong to a hierarchical tree. A simple example of inheritance could be a child inheriting the hair color from a parent. Here the parent and child are obviously a part of the hierarchy, a family, parent is the giver and child is the taker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same can be translated to programming also. Here instead of hair color, one class can inherit information from the other class. The information could be the attributes or methods or both. \n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP terminologies, the source class from which the information is inherited is called as the 'PARRENT' class while the other class which inherits the information is called as the 'CHILD' class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The information transfer can happen through different paths, for example, one PARENT class to one CHILD class (simple inheritance), multiple PARENT classes to one CHILD Class (multiple inheritance), one PARENT class to many CHILD classes and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will focus on SIMPLE INHERITANCE to understand the basic inheritance concepts and then finally dive into MULTIPLE INHERITANCE."

    "## Why Inheritance ??\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we were happy with functions and modules, then as an improvisation, we moved to OOPs using Classes and Objects to improve modularity of the code. Then we started using 'Abstraction' to hide unnecessary information from users. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now why are we even bothering to learn about INHERITANCE ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideology of classes and objects is to group similar entities under the same roof. Imagine, what if further subgrouping is possible where most of the information in the downstream groups are going to flow down from the top most class. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we all know dogs, lions and bears fall into the category of animals. Based on what we previously discussed, I can use a class to describe the attributes and methods of an animal and then create further objects to capture different attribute values for dogs, lions and bears. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider, I want to deal with different breeds of dogs. Does it really sound meaningful to have different objects for each breed of a dog from animal class. ?? Sounds a bit disturbing, right ??\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance to the rescue. I can create classes for dogs, lions and bears as CHILD classes of single PARENT animal class, then further downstream create CHILD class for each type of animal to get their breeds. When we do this, all the information passed on-to the PARENT animal class will be flowed down to all downsteam CHILD classes, we avoid repeating the features addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage of inheritance is that, CHILD classes can always modify the inherited data and also extend the list of attributes and methods within them without impacting the PARENT class. Sounds meaningful, Yes ?? For me, it does (;\n",
    "\n",
    "Crisply speaking, CHILD classes can override or extend the attributes and methods of parent classes. In other words, CHILD classes inherit all of the PARENT’s attributes and methods but can also specify attributes and methods that are unique to themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us move into the Python part now..."
