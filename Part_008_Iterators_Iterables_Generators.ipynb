We need to be able to iterate over an iterable without missing any value or repeating the value at a certain index position. To achieve this, there should exist some mechanism that can store the current index postion of the iterable that is being iterated over. This is exactly where ITERATORS come into the picture. An iterable cannot be iterated upon directly, it needs to be converted into an iterator before it can be iterated upon.\n",
