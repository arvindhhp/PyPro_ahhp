    "## Operator Overloading and Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, welcome to the last sector of the Introduction to Python Programming for Non-tech professionalsâ€™ series. I am excited to write this article and I am guessing you too are excited to read this. We have come quite a long way. The best part is, we get to end this series with a relatively easier and common concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chuck the fancy terms, let us first try to contemplate on what overloading means? \n",
    "\n",
    "Some entity is overloaded when it is asked to perform more than it is supposed to. The entity has been assigned to perform some actions, which are pre-defined but due to certain additional requirements, some additioanl actions are falling onto its head. Just like a responsible and accountable professional like you at times get over loaded with work as and when new responsibilities are picked up. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the same things can happen to operators also. As per mathematics, the plus sign (addition operator), '+', is supposed to add two numbers. But what if, we define a certain method implementation within a class that forces the plus sign to multiply two inputs. Sounds weird, right?? But here I am just trying to give a feel of what operator over loading is. We will look at the practical aspects soon enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What about Polymorphism then?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another very common term which just refers to the art of capability of some entity to take up various forms. Well, let me consider myself as an entity, I am a fluid system analyst when working, a lazy human on weekends, a student trying to communicate Python while writing this article etc., get it ?? We ourselves display the concept of polymorphism on a daily basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in programming, we can have the same objet perform differently at different instances. For example, the same method defined within a class can produce different return values for different arguments, sounds obvious, but this is just polymorphism being displayed. Another example, let us go back to the plus sign, the addition operator (+), as we discussed above, ignore the operator overloading part, just think about the plus sign we all know. It can performs arithmetical addition for numerical inputs, string concatenation for string inputs, list appending for list inputs, fascinating, isn't it ?? \n",
    "\n",
    "Exactly, that is how Python implements Polymorphism. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I can guess the thought itching your mind, we could simply consider, OPERATOR OVERLOADING is just a form of POLYMORPHISM where we specify what the operator should do. We will talk more about this soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us jump into OPERATOR overloading then."

    "To exploit the feature of operator overloading, we need to use the in-built method implementation of the particular operator. We just perform a METHOD OVERRIDING here. As we are aware, all the user defined classes, all the methods defined inside it, whatever be it, all become a part of THE 'main' class by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, all the user defined classes become subclass of the master class 'main'. \n",
