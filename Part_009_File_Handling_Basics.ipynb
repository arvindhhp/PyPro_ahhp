    "# File Object\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, we are quite familiarized with the fact that, PYTHON is a OBJECT Referening language. It likes to interpret everything as an aobject, an integer object, a float object, a list object, a boolean object, a string object and what not !!!!!!!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Same way, a file object is the instance which is created that references to the file which is being worked upon. So whenever, we want to work in a certain file, we use this object name rather than the whole file path just like any other variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For the purpose of the initial parts of the notebook, we will assume the files we are dealing with are present in the same folder from where the anaconda/jupyter notebook is launched from. This means, we need not provide the full path links to access these files. For files present outside the current working directory, we need to provide the complete path. This will be discussed in the directory handling section of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "# File Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode represents what is the user's intention behind accessing a file. File mode is the answer to the question, \"What do you want to do with the file\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A few possible modes are : READING, WRITING, APPENDING, OPENING A FILE IN BINARY Mode etc. All these modes are represented by keywords like 'r' for reading,'w' for wrting etc. I would stringly advice everyone to read through the doctring of .open() ny using SHIFT+TAB in the main code. All the modes and their keywords are listed there.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Truncation\n",
    "\n",
    "Truncation refers to the process of resizing resizing any object to a preferred size. When it comes to file handling in Python, by default, truncation of file refers to clearing the complete contents of the target file and place the cursor at the start of the empty file. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Writing vs Appending\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a file is opened in WRITE mode to edit, the file gets TRUNCATED. The new data gets overwritten replacing the old data. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, when a file is opened in APPEND mode, the file is NOT TRUNCATED. The cursor postion remains at the last position inside the file, newly fed data just gets added to the tail of the exisitng data in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cursor Position\n",
    "\n",
    "Nah, nothing fancy, this is just the position where the cursor is during any point of the program execution. Whenever a file is opened in append or write mode, the new data gets added from the cursor position. Similarly, whenever a file read option is executed the cursor position controls which part of the file is read. We will discuss on how the cursor positoning works in the upcoming blocks of our notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Seek\n",
    "\n",
    "Just a continuation to the cursor position, seek() helps us in placing the cursor at any desired position within the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guess, that is it, we are good to go to handle files. "
