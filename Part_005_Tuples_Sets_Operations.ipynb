    "\n",
    "MUTABILITY is the concept around updation of a particular object. Mutable ojects are those that can be updated. Immutable ojects are those that cannot be updated. Some other immutable ojects are strings, integers, floating point numbers etc. For the purpose of the current discussion, let us just understand this much, IMMUTABLE ojects are those, which has some information stored at a certain memory location, and the content at this specific memory location cannot be modified. On the other hand, LISTS are MUTABLE. That is exactly why we can add, delete, insert or perform any such operations on lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "And yes, why tuples, I have some private data or some sensitive data which is not supposed to be updated or touched or meddled with along the exection of the code, example, passwords, student's exam scores etc... Such things can be stored using tuples."
